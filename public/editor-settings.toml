# Metadata
##

[metadata]
# If the metadata editor appears in the main menu
# Type: boolean
# Default: true

## Metadata display configuration
## Override various settings for how metadata catalogs and fields will be
## displayed in the editor. Configuration happens for each catalog separately.
##
## Configuration options for fields:
##
##   show (boolean): Show or hide fields
##   readonly (boolean): Mark fields as readonly
##
## Default behavior:
##
## - The default settings are based on Opencast's admin interface configuration
## - If catalogs are not specified, all of its fields will be displayed
## - If a catalog is specified but empty, it will not be displayed
##
## Example:
##
# # This is the default catalog
# [metadata.configureFields."EVENTS.EVENTS.DETAILS.CATALOG.EPISODE"]
# title = {show = true, readonly = false}
# subject = {show = false}
# description = {readonly = true}
#
# # This catalog is specified but empty, and as such will not be displayed
# [metadata.configureFields."NameOfAnExtendedMetadataCatalog"]
