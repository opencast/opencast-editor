# For visualization purposes, the editor generates a waveform image for the
# cutting view. Per default the image is generated from one of the videos.
# For large videos, this can take a lot of time, bandwidth and in case of very
# large videos even cause the editor to crash.
# This setting allows you to specify an Opencast flavor from which to generate
# the waveform image instead. For example, your workflow in Opencast could
# include an operation that generates a small audio file from one of the videos
# and adds that audio file to the internal publication.
# Example:
[opencast.audioFileFlavor]

"subtype" = "audio"
